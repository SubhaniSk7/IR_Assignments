# Information-Retrieval

 - In assignments some datasets(20newsgroup etc.) are stored as .zip file but all the folders in dataset are not used. see question paper accordingly for respective dataset folders to use.
 - outputs(.sav) are saved as .zip files.(original .sav files are mostly sparse vector outputs which takes large amount of space-> so zipped and stored).
